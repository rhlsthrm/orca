# OMP RPC Chat adapter — working plan and state

Tracking issue: [stablyai/orca#10099](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/issues/10099)
Branch: `feat/omp-rpc-chat-adapter` (fork `rhlsthrm/orca`)

## Goal

Make Orca's Chat UI a real OMP JSONL RPC v2 client, as the first built-in
`input:"rpc"` / `transcript:"rpc"` structured agent adapter described in #10099. Orca
already ships the workspace shell and an OMP *transcript-tailing* Chat UI; the missing
load-bearing piece is protocol-faithful RPC, which is what unlocks streaming turns,
RPC-native questions/approvals, and extension UI.

Exit criterion is **full OMP parity**, delivered as a single full-parity PR, plus hands-on
UAT. Partial-parity PRs are explicitly not the plan.

## Source of truth

`src/shared/omp-rpc-protocol.ts` is the wire contract in code — prefer it over any prose.
This document records only decisions and live-probe facts that code does not carry.

## Shipped (this branch, oldest first)

| Commit | Content |
|---|---|
| `c6c94e922` | Shared RPC v2 wire contract + client interface |
| `35584140d` | Probe exposed over IPC (`ompRpc:getCommands`, `ompRpc:runLocalCommand`); `src/shared/omp-rpc-ipc-contract.ts` |
| `3d1b0d227` | Live catalog in composer; `/usage` routed off PTY to RPC, rendered with a "local command — agent not invoked" marker |
| `e91703bb6` | RPC v2 client: spawn, framing, ready validation, negotiation, strict chunk reassembly, correlation, scripted fake child (16 tests) |
| `5a14213e3` | Executable resolver — see "Traps" below (7 tests) |
| `aba1a9214` | Env-gated live probe against the installed `omp` (`ORCA_OMP_RPC_LIVE=1`) |
| `763add4d4` | Registers OMP `session_start` across four gates; also fixes a latent `prime-agent` drop |
| `a818b1d02` | Exclusive session ownership + proof-gated RPC↔PTY handoff (61 tests) |

## Verified live facts (OMP 18.0.6, `/Users/rahul/.local/bin/omp`)

- `ready` frame advertises `protocolVersion: 1`, `supportedProtocolVersions: [1, 2]`,
  `maxFrameBytes: 1048576`, `maxReassembledFrameBytes: 67108864`. v2 negotiation succeeds.
- Command catalog returns 487–494 entries, including user-defined `/skill:*` commands.
- `prompt {message:"/usage"}` emits `command_output` frames, then a response carrying
  `data.agentInvoked: false`. Local commands must therefore **never** synthesize an
  assistant turn.
- v2 chunking is strictly in-order: one pending sequence, must start at index 0,
  `count >= 2`, per-chunk payload ≤256KiB, total `byteLength` ≥1MiB and ≤64MiB, exact
  byte-length match on completion. Deviations are protocol faults to surface, not tolerate
  — do not add an out-of-order/dedupe reassembler.
- Tool approval has **no dedicated frame**. It arrives as `extension_ui_request` with
  `method: "select"`, a free-text prompt, and Approve/Deny options.
- OMP has **no checkpoint verb**. Continuity is only `switch_session {sessionPath}` and
  `new_session {parentSession?}`, so checkpointing is a host-side convention.

## Design decisions

- **Ownership registry is the only safety mechanism.** OMP does not enforce single-writer,
  so `src/shared/claimed-agent-rpc-owner.ts` deliberately shares *one* registry with
  `claimed-agent-pty-owner.ts` rather than standing up a parallel one. An RPC child and a
  PTY child must never write the same OMP session concurrently.
- **Handoff ordering is the invariant:** dispose → prove exit → release → resume. An
  unprovable exit keeps the claim held and returns `unverifiable` (fail closed).
- **Never hardcode OMP surface.** Slash commands come from the catalog at runtime; the
  typed decoder is a floor, not a ceiling (`command_output` is untyped).
- **Raw frames:** opt-in, bounded diagnostic capture. Not a durable ledger.
- No dynamic third-party adapter loader and no arbitrary renderer code — built-in adapter
  only, against #10099's contract.

## Open work, in recommended order

1. **Streaming turns over RPC** — `prompt` / `steer` / `follow_up` / `abort`, message and
   tool frames into `NativeChat`. Do this next, and note it *subsumes* item 2: because
   `a818b1d02` gives the RPC child session ownership, the chat view can read from the
   session it already owns instead of depending on transcript resolution.
2. **Hook delivery to the renderer for OMP panes** — currently broken end to end. Four
   code gates were fixed in `763add4d4` and unit-proven, but a live pane still records
   nothing after a *complete* turn. Proven chain: no hook event → `recordAgentProviderSession`
   never fires → no provider session id → `nativeChat.readSession` returns
   `{error:"Transcript unavailable", notFound:true}` → the chat view renders the user
   message but never the assistant reply, and `agentStatusByPaneKey` stays empty. `/usage`
   is unaffected only because it bypasses the transcript entirely.
   Prime suspect: prod and dev builds write the same
   `~/.omp/agent/extensions/orca-agent-status.ts`, so hook endpoint routing can cross apps.
   Check whether the extension embeds an endpoint at write time or reads it from env at
   runtime (`src/main/pi/agent-status-extension-source.ts`,
   `src/main/ipc/pty/host-env/pi-agent.ts`, `src/shared/agent-hook-endpoint-file.ts`).
3. Questions/approvals + extension UI answered over RPC, not synthesized PTY keystrokes.
4. Subagent frames; unknown-frame diagnostic rendering; opt-in raw capture.
5. Expand RPC command routing beyond the current `/usage`-only allowlist.
6. Subscribe to OMP's `session_switch` event — flagged by `763add4d4`, still unsubscribed.
7. SSH/remote runtime locality; mobile read parity (`nativeChatRequiresLocalTranscript`
   semantics change once RPC bypasses disk).
8. Upstream PR against #10099, then UAT.

## Traps that cost real time

- `hydrateShellPath` (`src/main/startup/hydrate-shell-path.ts`) caches its result promise
  process-wide **including a cold-start timeout failure**, which made `omp` permanently
  unresolvable (`executable-not-found` forever). `src/main/ipc/omp-rpc-executable-resolver.ts`
  works around it: bare PATH → hydration → *forced* re-hydration → well-known posix
  installer paths. Do not "simplify" this back into a single hydration call.
- An empty `agentStatusByPaneKey` on a booted-but-unprompted pane is **designed** —
  identity routes to the cold-restore map (`sleepingAgentSessionsByPaneKey`). Do not treat
  it as the bug; the real gap only appears after a full turn.
- Reaching the Chat UI requires a tab with `launchAgent: "omp"` (New tab → OMP). Typing
  `omp` into a plain shell leaves `launchAgent: null` and the chat toggle stays gated.
- Use `npx -y pnpm@10.24.0`; the repo pins 10.24.0. Dev builds get a separate userData
  namespace and a deterministic CDP port of 9432.
- Repo gates that bite: oxlint forbids `Array<T>`; child processes only via
  `src/shared/child-process/`; `.ts` not `.d.ts` for owned types in `src/preload`/`src/shared`;
  never add a `max-lines` disable — split the file.

## Verification baseline

Full sweep on this branch: 11,626 tests passing / 83 skipped; `tc:node` and `tc:cli`
clean; `tc:web` clean apart from 9 pre-existing failures in
`src/renderer/src/components/automations/**` that arrived with upstream `cda2280d6`;
`electron-vite build` clean. Live: 494-command catalog and `/usage` rendering correctly in
the dev app.
